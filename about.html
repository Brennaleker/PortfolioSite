  <h1> About me </h1>
  <p><img src="img/brenna.jpg" alt="Photograph of Brenna Leker" class="profile-photo">I love learning, creating things, sharing ideas, letting my nerd flag fly and tinkering around on computers.  This has translated into a fascination with web development.<p>  
  <p> It all started with a baking blog.  I had a clear vision of what I wanted but I could not find any free WordPress templates that matched my needs.  I taught myself a bit of code and used my spring break – I was a public school teacher at the time – to hack away at the Twenty Ten theme source code until I had something I was happy with.<p>
  <p>Flash forward a few years and I found myself once again learning to code for fun; losing track of time on Treehouse, Codecademy and tinkering on my own projects.  I decided it was time to get serious and took a few courses through Peninsula Community College.</p>
  <p> I am a front-end web developer with a passion for making the web a better place, a fascination with JS and an excitement for language.<p>
  <p>I am currently working on personal projects, hunting for a position doing what I love and continuing to delve deeper into the intricacies of CSS and JavaScript.</p>
